       <h2>History of Indian Cricket</h2>
        <p>The crickrt was introduced to the indian subcontinent by european merchant 
        sailors in the 18th centuray, and the first cricket club was established in 
        1792 by <br>British expatriates from the East India Company.<br>
        The Father Of Indian Cricket-SIR RANJITSINHJI VIBHAJI JADEJA Born in Sadodar, a village in the state of Nawanagar, Ranji's first taste of cricket was
        at Rajkumar College where he first represented the school in 1883 and was appointed captain in 1884 at only 12 years old.
        In 1888, Ranji travelled to London where he began studying at Cambridge University.
        It was during his time at Cambridge that Ranji's cricketing skills drastically improved and soon he found himself 
        playing first class cricket for Cambridge University and county cricket for Sussex. After experiencing success at county level,
        Ranji made his Test debut for England on 16 July 1896, an incredibly controversial decision at the time.
        Ranji played extremely well on debut against Australia, silencing critics with a second innings score of 154 not out.
        Ranji was considered a very unorthodox batsmen at the time and he brought a whole new style of batting to the game.
        He was known to play more off his back foot in both defense and attack, he is also known for
        popularising the 'leg glance' shot. His wristwork and unconventional shot-making were unusual to 
        the British who embraced a more orthodox approach. His success in England and peculiar style led
        to him becoming one of the most popular players in the British Empire
        and was a major contributing factor to the rise of Indian cricket in the 20th century.<br>
        In 1928, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was established and shortly after the ICC admitted India as a full member,
         granting them official test match status.
         It wasn't until 1932 that India had the opportunity to play their first test match against England.
